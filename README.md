# RL in Self Driving Cars - SoC
Reinforcement Learning project in self driving cars as part of Seasons of Code (SoC) 2025 at IIT Bombay.

Weekly Tasks for the project are published at [https://github.com/Yash16Gupta/RL_in_SelfDrivingCars_SOC25](https://github.com/Yash16Gupta/RL_in_SelfDrivingCars_SOC25)

## (Week 3) Assignment 1
### Task 2. FrozenLake-v1
[Implementation](./assignment_1/frozenlake.py) of Tabular **Q-learning** with epsilon-greedy exploration

### Additionally Implemented
[Taxi-v3](https://github.com/kadapallaNithin/mini_projects/blob/master/RL/q_learning/taxi.py)

## (Week 5) [Assignment 2](./assignment_2/README.md)
[Implementation](./assignment_2/Assignment2.py) of a **Pure Pursuit Controller** for a car-like robot to follow a predefined path, using a kinematic bicycle
model. The implementation includes a **PID controller** for speed regulation.
